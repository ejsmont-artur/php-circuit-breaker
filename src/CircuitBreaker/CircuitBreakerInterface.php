/**
 * Allows user code to track avability/unavailability of any service by serviceName.
 * 
 * Circuit breaker counts each failure and once you reach limit it will skipp connection attempt with instant failure.
 * You can also set retry timeout per service. Then after retry timeout seconds CircuitBreaker will allow one
 * thread to try to connect to the service again. 
 *      - If thread fails CircuitBreaker waits till next retry timeout. 
 *      - If thread succeeds, more threads will be allowed to connect.
 * 
 * Main use case is to shield from remote service failures and be able to recover quickly with meaningful message.
 * 
 * Typical simplified user code would look like this:
 *      $result = false;
 *      if( $cb->isAvailable('myServiceName') ){
 *          if( HoweverYouConnectToTheService() ){
 *              $result = true;
 *              $cb->reportSuccess('myServiceName');
 *          }else{
 *              $cb->reportFailure('myServiceName');
 *          }
 *      }
 *
